OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the
application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having
to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for
full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

### This repository
Modern version of OpenWrt working on UZ801v3:
- Modem Working
  - ModemManager not showing Rx/Tx in Luci
- Wifi Working
- USB gadget working (NCM, RNDIS, MASS, ACM tested!)
  - No shell attached to ACM, just pure raw Serial (/dev/ttyGS0)
- TUN installed
- Wireguard Installed
- GRE Protocol Installed
- `hotplug.d` scripts to manage leds, only on/off if iface, no blinking:
  - On default Linux Kernel `dts`, leds are swapped!
  - Wifi Led: [packages/uz801-tweaks/files/wifi-led.hotplug](packages/uz801-tweaks/files/wifi-led.hotplug)
  - Modem Led: [packages/uz801-tweaks/files/modem-led.hotplug](packages/uz801-tweaks/files/modem-led.hotplug)

### How to build OpenWrt
Docker is required!
```bash
cd devenv
docker compose run --rm builder # This will open bash inside a build environment
cp /repo/diffconfig .config # Copies the config on to the working folder
make defconfig
make -j$(nproc)
```

### How to flash from OEM
The base partitions are in a folder called `base_partitions` on this repo:
- Install `edl`: https://github.com/bkerler/edl
- Put the device in `edl` mode: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Zhihe_series_LTE_dongles_(generic-zhihe)#How_to_enter_flash_mode
- Run `cd base_partitions && ./flash.sh`. The script will backup the important partitions specific for your device, will flash everything and will restore de previously saved partitions. During the execution, the script will halt and ask you to drag the boot and rootfs (system) partitions.

After the succesful flash if you:
- Want to enter `fastboot`, just insert the device with the button pressed.
- Want to enter `edl`, boot into fastboot and execute: `fastboot oem reboot-edl`.

### No Network/Modem Stuck at Searching

First, extract the contents of `modem.bin` from your firmware dump. You can do `eld r modem modem.bin`. In linux, its a simple image, you can mount it. Once you have it mounted, navigate to this directory: `image/modem_pr/mcfg/configs/mcfg_sw/generic/` and choose the folder according to your region:

- **APAC** - Asia Pacific
- **CHINA** - China
- **COMMON** - Use this if your region is not listed
- **EU** - Europe
- **NA** - North America
- **SA** - South America
- **SEA** - South East Asia

Once you have selected your region, you'll find folders typically representing Telcos in your area. Navigate through the appropriate folder until you locate `mcfg_sw.mbn`. If your telco is not listed, just grab a generic as it is done in this project for europe:
```makefile
  # packages/qcom-firmware/Makefile
  define Build/Compile
      ...
  		::image/modem_pr/mcfg/configs/mcfg_sw/generic/common/default/default/mcfg_sw.mbn $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/uz801
      ...
  endef
```

#### To apply the fix:
1. Transfer the file to your dongle: `scp -O mcfg_sw.mbn root@192.168.1.1:/lib/firmware/MCFG_SW.MBN`
   - **Capitalization matters!** Modem expects it to be all caps.
3. Reboot the device.

### Future:
- Custom package server for msm89xx/msm8916
  - Any target specific module not present might require to be built from sources. This repo can be used to do that, run `make menuconfig` before `make -j$(nproc)` and select it from the menu.
- `msm-firmware-loader`, to mount firmware instead of bundle to free up almost 40mb from rootfs.
